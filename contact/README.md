# Contact Module

## Overview

The `contact` module is responsible for managing and displaying contact-related information within
the application. It encapsulates all logic, UI elements, and data handling specifically related to
contacts, such as displaying a list of contacts, viewing contact details, and handling contact
interactions.

This module helps maintain a clear separation of concerns by isolating contact-related
functionalities from other parts of the application, resulting in a more modular and maintainable
codebase.

Welcome to ENGAGE-HF, your personalized heart health companion! Developed by Stanford University using the Stanford Spezi framework in collaboration with the DOT HF network, funded by the American Heart Association Health Tech SFRN, this app is designed to make managing heart failure easier and more effective.

With ENGAGE-HF, you have the power to optimize your heart failure treatment plan and improve your overall well-being. Our app simplifies the process of getting the best combination of medicines to help you live longer and healthier. By tracking your vitals and health status over time, you'll be more engaged in your heart failure care, allowing for personalized interventions and better health outcomes.

Your heart health journey begins with the main dashboard, where you'll find daily check-ins and two-week check-ins, closely monitoring your heart health. During your daily check-in, you'll provide vital health status information, and the app will help you track your medication adherence, giving you valuable insights into your progress.

We encourage active participation in your heart health management, and to motivate you further, ENGAGE-HF features an engagement score. By completing app activities, like answering daily health status questions, reporting medication adherence, and checking vitals, you'll increase your score, empowering you to stay on track.

Inside the app, you'll discover three main pages: Vitals, Health Status, and Medication. The Vitals page lets you view your blood pressure, heart rate, and weight measurements. On the Health Status page, we utilize the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12 (KCCQ-12), the dizziness questionnaire, and the daily health status question, giving you a comprehensive view of your heart failure symptoms and overall well-being. The Medication page offers detailed information about your core heart failure medications.

The Health Summary feature presents a comprehensive overview of vitals, health status scores, and medications, empowering you to prepare questions for your clinicians. Easily share a PDF summary with healthcare providers or caregivers, fostering collaborative care.

The ENGAGE-HF app offers short educational videos to deepen your understanding of heart failure management. Learn about app usage, heart failure medications, and monitoring from expert insights provided by the American Heart Association and the Heart Failure Society of America.
